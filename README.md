# Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing - Welcome to My Repo!

In this repo, I make documentation about my exploration in monitoring, logging, and tracing apps. Currently, I am focusing on tools from Grafana, but there is also possibility I will try other tools beside Grafana's.

## Prerequisites
Since I use Docker Compose for running most of the tools, it's important to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host. You can follow the tutorial from Docker's official documentation page https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Monitoring
Stack: Prometheus, Grafana dashboard

## Logging
Stack: Loki, Promtail, Grafana dashboard

## Tracing
Stack: Tempo, OpenTelemetry Collector, Grafana dashboard
